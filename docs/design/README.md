# Design Notes (v0.1)

## Objectives
- Fast, legible UI that works across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Emphasize collaborative cues (active speaker, guessing feedback, reactions).
- Provide accessible color palettes and high-contrast defaults.

## Initial Tasks
- Map core flows: create room → lobby → drawing → results.
- Define component inventory (buttons, modals, canvas toolbar, chat feed, scoreboard).
- Produce responsive layouts for 1280px desktop and 390px mobile breakpoints.
- Establish motion guidelines for stroke replay, timers, and feedback animations.

## Deliverables
- Figma wireframes (lo-fi) with annotations for breakpoints and accessibility.
- UI kit documentation feeding `packages/ui-kit` tokens.
- UX content guidelines for prompts, hints, error states.

## Collaboration Notes
- Designer syncs daily with Frontend agent to align on component contracts.
- A11y agent runs audits alongside QA during milestone reviews.
