# AGENTS.md — Teach-Me Multi-Agent Operating Manual
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
This file defines the agents, their objectives, interfaces, KPIs, guardrails, and handoffs for a full product build from 0→1. Every agent runs in **Coach Mode** by default: while doing the work, it also teaches what it’s doing, with 1–3 bite-size notes and links to artifacts.

## Global Conventions

**Task object (shared across agents)**
```yaml
task_id: string
title: string
owner_agent: enum
priority: P0|P1|P2
deadline: ISO8601
inputs: [links_or_blobs]
outputs: [links_or_blobs]
acceptance_criteria: [checks]
risk: low|med|high
status: todo|in_progress|review|blocked|done
deps: [task_id]
```

**Artifact registry**
- `/docs`: PRD, specs, RFCs, MoMs, decisions
- `/design`: user flows, wireframes, UI kits
- `/app`: src/** (frontend, backend), infra/**, tests/**
- `/data`: schemas, sample data, notebooks, metrics
- `/ml`: datasets, features, model code, evals, model cards
- `/ops`: runbooks, on-call, SLAs, dashboards
- `/gtm`: messaging, assets, decks
- `/legal`: contracts, DPAs, DPIA/PIA, licenses
- `/security`: threat models, STRIDE, pentest, checklists

**Stage gates**
1) **PRD sign-off** (PM, Legal skim if regulated)  
2) **Design/Arch review** (Designer, FE/BE, DevOps, Security)  
3) **Data/Model review** (DS, MLE, Security)  
4) **Go-to-Market review** (PM, Marketing, Sales, Legal)  
5) **Launch review** (Ops, QA, Security, PM)

**Common KPIs across agents**
- Predictability: plan vs actual (±%)
- Quality: escaped defects, severity mix, CFR, churn
- Velocity: lead/cycle time, throughput
- Outcome: activation, retention, revenue, NPS
