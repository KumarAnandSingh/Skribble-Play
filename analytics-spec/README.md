## Objectives
- Align telemetry with KPIs defined in the PRD (engagement, quality, safety, growth).
- Document event contracts, property dictionaries, and dashboard requirements.
- Maintain experiment guardrails for future feature flags.

## Next Steps
1. Draft event taxonomy (`events.md`) covering client and server events.
2. Define warehouse schema and ETL/ELT pipeline assumptions.
3. Align with Data agent on instrumentation milestones per development phase.
